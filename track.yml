      This track uses a single node Kubernetes cluster on a sandbox virtual machine.
      Please wait while we boot the VM for you and start Kubernetes.

      ## Objectives
      In this track, this is what you'll learn:
      - Deploy a webserver (NGINX) on kubernetes
      - Expose the deployment with a NodePort service
      - View the exposed service with an embedded tab in Instruqt
      - Explore the Kubernetes dashboard on the sandbox VM
  assignment: |-
    Use the terminal to deploy nginx:

    ```
    kubectl create deployment nginx --image nginx
    ```
